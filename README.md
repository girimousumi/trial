Millions of individuals throughout the world suffer from the terrible health condition known as chronic kidney disease. A patient's ability to effectively manage their condition can be greatly enhanced by early disease identification. 
Yet, it can be difficult to diagnose chronic kidney disease since symptoms might not show up until the condition has advanced sufficiently.
We can identify people who are at a high risk of developing chronic kidney disease and take early preventive action by creating predictive models for the condition. To find patterns and risk factors related to chronic kidney disease, machine learning algorithms can be trained on massive datasets of patient health data, including demographics, medical history, and test findings.

In order to identify patients who are at a high risk of developing chronic kidney disease, the chronic kidney disease prediction project uses machine learning algorithms to create predictive models. Large databases of patient health data, including demographics, medical history, and test findings, are used to train these algorithms. The project's goal is to assist healthcare professionals in taking early action with individualised therapies to either prevent or manage chronic kidney disease by detecting trends and risk factors related to the condition. The project's objective is to enhance patient outcomes and lessen the burden of chronic kidney disease, which will ultimately result in lifesaving and quality-of-life improvements for millions of individuals around the world.

✅ Collect data.
✅ Preprocess data: The data needs to be cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.
